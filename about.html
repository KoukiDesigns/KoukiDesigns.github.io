				<p>I grew up in a Brisbane suburb, Holland Park, closely with my two brothers. My father was a coach body builder by trade who moved on to running his own sales company. My family is mechanically and hands-on inclined, which I believe gives me my hands-on approach to the projects that I develop. My love for design began when I first tried out the subject on offer offer at my highschool, discovering that I greatly excelled at it.</p>


<p>I then proceeded to complete a Certificate IV in Multimedia while still in highschool, leading on to doing Multimedia Design at the University of Queensland, then to Interactive and Visual Design at the Queensland University of Technology.</p>


<p>I try to approach my design with a unique, different and engaging style that still remains proffessional and usable. </p>

<p>In my spare time, I love skateboarding, playing and performing with my guitar, tennis and working on/building old guitars. Iâ€™m also heavily into car and drift culture. These hobbies shape a large part of who I am and what I believe in. </p>
